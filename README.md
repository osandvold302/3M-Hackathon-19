# Post-It Hub  
This is the repo for the 3M 2019 Hackathon project hack "Post-It Portal".  

## Goals  
We would like to build a Post-It dispenser with a wireless charging port, amplifying speaker, 
and Amazon dash button. This dash button will be used as an emergency supply stock purchase button 
and will trigger a web application to display the order.
